# City Rankers
**Welcome to City Rankers!**  
Created by: Aspen Boler, Evan Dyson, and Connor Munjed

The problem we are trying to solve is how to make choosing a new city to move to less difficult by providing a list of cities that are chosen depending on the userâ€™s preferences.  

The preferences we will take in will include: Population, Pop. density, City size, Average income, and Average housing costs.  
We will let the user choose between using a merge sort or a radix sort to sort their options.  

The data we will use for the list of cities will be 100,000 randomly generated cities with random quantities assigned to each catagory. This is due to our team not being able to find a list of cities large enough to fit our projects requirement of 100,000.

For visuals we implemented a GUI which uses a library called Dear ImGui and GLFW libraries. All of which are open-source.
