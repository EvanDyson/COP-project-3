# THESE FILES WILL NOT RUN THEY ARE JUST FOR VISUALIZING THE CODE
 - tower.jpg is the background image
 - main.cpp is the main file for the GUI, it is not created by me. I have only modified it.
 - CityRanker.h is the file that opens the .csvfile created by Connor, reads it line by line and grabs all the info needed for the cities. It then pushes the cities onto a vector.
 - The vector created in CityRanker.h is then sent to and sorted in sort.h created by Aspen.
 - City.h is the file that holds the struct for city. It also holds the equation used to make the weighted scored created by Evan
 - main.cpp calls CityRankers() which only holds one function, it sends back a sorted vector.
     - CityRanker takes in an int x which will be 1 for merge sort or 2 for radix sort
     - It also takes in all the parameters for the weighted score equation.
     - The parameter will = 0 if it is unused. 
     - It also takes in 2 bools which detect if the input window is open and if the sort algorithm has been run yet.
